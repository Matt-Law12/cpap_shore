## Project Overview
The Cat Point Living Shoreline project is a Deepwater Horizon Phase III early restoration project. As a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and associated response activities, benthic secondary productivity and salt marsh habitats along Florida’s Panhandle suffered adverse impacts. This project seeks to foster reef and salt marsh habitat development, which will help compensate the public for spill-related injuries and losses to benthic secondary productivity and salt marsh habitat.

The Cat Point Living Shoreline project employs living shoreline techniques that utilize natural breakwater material to reduce shoreline erosion, provide habitat, and protect recovering salt marshes at Cat Point, Florida. The living shoreline breakwaters were constructed in 2019-2020 at the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve (ANERR) in Eastpoint, Florida, in Franklin County (Figure 1). The specific breakwater elevation and design was selected to maximize shoreline protection and meet state regulatory requirements. The living shoreline techniques were employed along approximately 0.3 miles of shoreline. This area has been the location of previous successful living shoreline projects that contribute to shoreline protection. 

Saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora – recently classified as Sporobolus alterniflorus by Peterson et al. 2014), saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), and sea oats (Uniola paniculata) were planted in suitable locations landward of the breakwaters in late spring 2020. Because of wash-out events and plant die-offs, additional saltmarsh cordgrass planting occurred in early 2021 and 2022.

## Data Collection
### Breakwater: 
Monitoring was performed according to the methods outlined in Baggett et al. (2014). Bivalve composition of the breakwaters was monitored during December 2021 (Year 1), December 2022 (Year 2), February 2024 (Year 3), and [] 2025 (Year 4). Quadrats (0.25m2) were placed along three transects on each breakwater, at the east end, middle, and west end. On each of these transects, a quadrat was placed on the landward side, crest, and seaward side (Figure 12). This was done across 16 breakwaters, resulting in 144 measured quadrats for a total area of 36m2. In each quadrat, the number of oysters was counted, using visual approximation to divide them into size classes (Adults: ≥75mm; Seed: 26-74mm; Spat: ≤25mm), and the percent coverage of oysters was estimated.

### Epifauna: 
Epifauna species monitoring on the artificial breakwaters was performed according to the methods outlined in Baggett et al. (2014). To determine the epifauna species composition of the breakwaters, sediment trays consisting of 26.5“x 22” high-density polyethylene bread trays were deployed on each breakwater. The trays were lined with 2mm mesh and filled with 10kg of granite (the same material used inside breakwater mattresses) and 5kg of oyster shell for a total substrate weight of 15kg. Each breakwater had one tray deployed at a random location on the landward side for a total of 16 sediment trays (240kg of fill material). Placement alternated between the base and the crest of the breakwaters. In instances where the randomly selected basket location was unsuitable for placement (e.g. the randomly selected base location was buried in sediment), the basket was moved to a nearby suitable location. Sediment trays were deployed on October 2, 2023, and retrieved November 14 & December 13, 2023 for Year 3 sampling. All substrate material was removed and weighed, and all organisms present were collected for future identification. Samples were fixed in formalin for three days and then transferred to 70% ethanol to better preserve the organisms. Individuals were viewed under a microscope, identified to the lowest possible taxon, and measured. Measurements were determined based on standard practices for specific taxa. 

### Vegetation: 
To date, vegetation monitoring has been performed at all RPs at approximately six months, one year, and two years after the initial planting dates. For areas that were initially planted in 2021, the three-year annual monitoring has also been completed (Table 8). Monitoring transects are located perpendicular to the shoreline and vary in length, depending on the size and shape of each planting area. Each transect was randomly generated within the planting area, and a sufficient number of transects were selected in each RP to ensure that a minimum of 10% of all planted clumps were included (Figure 21). Starting from the seaward edge, a 1m2 quadrat was flipped end to end along the length of the transect, and within each quadrat, percent cover and height were recorded. Percent cover was determined within each 1m² quadrat surveyed, and height was determined by measuring the height of ten ‘haphazardly’ selected stems within each quadrat. The percent of original coverage was determined by estimating the coverage of any remaining plants from the original planted clump. Within that same area, the number of living plants was calculated and the percent survival was estimated from this evaluation. This process was repeated at Year 1 for all RPs. Future monitoring of plant height and total percent cover will be conducted annually through the culmination of the project. 

### Marsh Spatial Extent: 
A Trimble® Geo7x is used to map the extent of the Cat Point Living Shoreline planted marsh areas with sub-meter accuracy. Using Trimble® TerraSync™ software, data is collected by walking the extent of the planting areas as the GPS continuously collects points to create a polygon. These polygons are then analyzed in ArcGIS® Pro to determine the spatial extent of each planting area. To date, total area calculations have been conducted biannually to both include newly planted areas and document expansion of existing RPs. 

## Data Analysis
All of the collected data was entered into an excel spreadsheet. From there, I utilized Python, specifically the Pandas and Matplotlob packages mainly, to complete the analysis and create graphs that helped in visualizing our data and 

I also created an [interactive PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODhhZGQxZmYtYjYzYy00MTQ0LWI3M2EtZmE3NzdlODdlOGE3IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9) geared more specifically towards individuals with little to no prior knowledge of the project. The dashboard enables users to explore key insights through dynamic visuals, making complex data more accessible and engaging—far beyond what static graphs or traditional reports can offer.
