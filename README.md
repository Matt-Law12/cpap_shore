## Project Overview
The Cat Point Living Shoreline Project is part of the Deepwater Horizon Phase III Early Restoration initiative. Following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the associated response efforts, benthic secondary productivity and salt marsh habitats along Florida’s Panhandle experienced significant damage. This project aims to restore and enhance reef and salt marsh habitats to help compensate the public for ecological injuries and losses resulting from the spill.

A living shoreline is a natural and sustainable approach to shoreline stabilization that uses native vegetation, oyster reefs, and other natural materials to reduce erosion, improve water quality, and support fish and wildlife habitat.

## Restoration Work

The Cat Point Living Shoreline project employs living shoreline techniques that utilize natural breakwater material to reduce shoreline erosion, provide habitat, and protect recovering salt marshes at Cat Point, Florida. The living shoreline breakwaters were constructed in 2019-2020 at the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve (ANERR) in Eastpoint, Florida, in Franklin County. The specific breakwater elevation and design was selected to maximize shoreline protection and meet state regulatory requirements. The living shoreline techniques were employed along approximately 0.3 miles of shoreline. This area has been the location of previous successful living shoreline projects that contribute to shoreline protection. 

Saltmarsh cordgrass, saltmeadow cordgrass, and sea oats were planted in suitable locations landward of the breakwaters in late spring 2020. Because of wash-out events and plant die-offs, additional saltmarsh cordgrass planting occurred in early 2021 and 2022.

## Why It Matters 
Living shorelines provide a wide range of environmental benefits, including: 

• Preventing Coastal Erosion <br />
• Providing habitat for both terrestrial and marine life <br />
• Improving water quality <br />

In addition to these environmental services, living shorelines also offer industrial and economic advantages. Living shorelines both stabilize coastal land and reduce wave energy, aiding in the preservation of coastal properties and businesses, especially during extreme weather events such as severe storms and hurricanes.

## Monitoring
To track how well the Cat Point Living Shoreline project is working, we’ve been monitoring different parts of the site over several years. This helps us understand how the habitat is growing and how wildlife is responding to the restoration efforts.

### Breakwater: 
We check the rock and oyster structures (called breakwaters) to see how oysters are growing. Surveys are done once a year by counting oysters in small sections across different parts of the breakwaters. We also group the oysters by size to understand how they are developing over time.

### Epifauna:
To find out what types of small animals are living on the breakwaters, we placed trays filled with rock and oyster shell underwater. These trays act like mini habitats, and after a few weeks, we collect them to see what has moved in. All the animals are identified and measured in the lab.

### Vegetation:
We also check how well the planted salt marsh grasses are growing. This happens at regular intervals—about 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after planting. We measure how much of the area is covered by plants, how tall they are, and how many of the original plants are still alive.

### Marsh Spatial Extent:
To track how much the marsh is expanding, we walk around the planted areas with a GPS device to map their size. This mapping is done twice a year to measure growth over time and to include any new planting zones.

Along with the annual monitoring reports that are published by CPAP, an [interactive PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODhhZGQxZmYtYjYzYy00MTQ0LWI3M2EtZmE3NzdlODdlOGE3IiwidCI6ImI2MjAxOTYwLTQ1YmEtNGI3OC1iMDgwLWYxYzQzM2ZmNmUzNiIsImMiOjZ9) was created which enables users to explore our monitoring data through dynamic visuals, making the complex data more accessible and engaging— far beyond what static graphs or traditional reports can offer.

## Results 
### Breakwater
The project goal is for the reef structures to maintain or exceed their original size and height by Year 5. As of Year 2, all standard breakwaters had an average height at or above the original constructed height of 0.69 meters. Monitoring will continue to confirm if this remains true through Year 5.

### Epifauna
The goal was for oysters and other bivalves to cover at least 50% of the breakwater surface by Year 2. This target was not met. In Year 2, the average coverage was approximately 38.7%. By Year 4 (2025), this improved slightly to about 43.5%, but the goal still remains unmet.

### Vegetation
The goal was for at least 80% of planted grasses to survive by the end of the first growing season. This target was not met, with average survival at 70%.
Another goal was for vegetation to reach at least 80% of its original planted cover by Year 1, and 75% total cover within the site by Year 5.

• Year 1: Percent cover was 69.9%, below the target. <br />
• Year 3 (current): Percent cover is estimated at 69.5%. Monitoring will continue to track progress toward the Year 5 goal. <br />

### Marsh Spatial Extent: 
In 2021, a total of 0.338 acres of vegetation had been planted. The original goal set for this restoration project was for the total marsh area to expand to 1 acre. As of March 2025 that goal has been exceeded at 1.06 acres of marsh area. Continued expansion of the current RPs is expected to occur.
